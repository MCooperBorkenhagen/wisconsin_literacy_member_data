Attended: Liz, Michele, Matt


Notes
- Some copy for sharing the data prototypes with wisconsin literacy member orgs:

Hi, I am Matt, a psychologist and adviser to Wisconsin Literacy. I am here to
share with you some of work that we've been doing at the Wisconsin Literacy
home office to help our member organizations understand how their communities
are performing with regard to youth and adult literacy relative to other
communities across the state.

We've designed a simple tool that allows you to look at literacy data
for your county as well as all other counties in Wisconsin. You can also
look at statewide data too. Let me show you how it works.

I will explain each variable that you can look at for your county, one variable
at a time. And when I say variable, I just mean a type of literacy measure that
you might be interested in knowing for your county. For example, "unemployment
rate" would be a variable. It is important that you know what each variable means,
too, so I will explain that as well.

While I explain each variable, I will also show you how you can go about
understanding looking up that variable for your county on the tool we've
designed for you.

percent_act_ela_below_basic
The first variable here is called "percent_act_ela_below_basic". This is one of
the ACT measures that we have available for you, and it comes from the ACT testing
that Wisconin high school students complete. You might be thinking, "wait, isn't
the ACT that placement test that students do to go to college? Wisconsin high
school students don't ALL take that test". If you are thinking this, don't worry:
all high school students do take a host of other tests throughout high school that
are designed by ACT - they just aren't the college placement ones.
The percent_act_ela_below_basic test is administered in 11th grade and tests
students skills in English, including writing and other language arts. So this
variable describes a measure of ability in writing and language arts more generally,
which includes other topics like grammar, spelling, and composition. This specific
number expresses the percent of a county that was classified as "below basic" on
this measure of language arts. This basically
means that this percentage of you county's test-taking high schoolers are performing in the
bottom 25 percent of all test-takers across the country on this test. Said differently,
lets say your county's "percent_act_ela_below_basic" is 10. This means that 10 percent
of your county's students (or 1 out of 10 students), are at the lowest level of
literacy measured on the test.


## notes
You don't need to express "below basic" mathematically; express it functionally.
You could say "bottom quarter", and what would be better is to describe "below basic"
in terms of "pre-literate" and other functional definitions.


# organize the columns in a logical, developmental progression
# relabel the columns so they are more descriptive


# action required:
# provide Liz a description of each variable and she will
# talk to Sarah
# by 9/5 write the whole script
